# Cursor File: mGenerate â€“ AI-Driven PDF Generation for mCase

## Category
Internal RedMane solution for cross-departmental use (delivery, legal, finance, sales, HR, security, etc.)

---

## Problem
Development and configuration teams spend excessive hours manually coding documents in mCase to compile person-specific information from multiple screens into a single PDF. Each client has unique use cases, which further increases development effort and introduces bugs.

---

## Proposed Solution
Introduce **mGenerate**, an AI-powered capability integrated with mCase. It will:
- Automatically extract selected information from various mCase screens/documents
- Provide a user-friendly interface to select desired data
- Generate a single consolidated PDF, reducing coding time and manual errors

---

## Value Proposition
- **Significant Time Savings**: Reduces 100s of hours spent on document generation per project  
- **Cost Efficiency**: Fewer hours = reduced project costs  
- **Reusability**: Once implemented, applies across clients and departments  
- **Enhanced Client Satisfaction**: Faster delivery of high-quality, consistent documents  

---

## Implementation Thoughts
Build an AI tool within mCase that:
- Locates relevant person-specific data  
- Presents a UI for user-driven selection  
- Outputs to a single formatted PDF
